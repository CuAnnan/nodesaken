        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This is the project home for the Node.js powered Forsaken&trade; Character Sheet tracking system. I've built several iterations of this, each building upon the experiences of the previous and becoming better both as I mature and as JavaScript matures.</p>
        <p>The last attempt at this stalled owing to health concerns, but I was prompted to resume owing to the advances of Node.js and wanting a piece of sufficiently involved domain specific software that I can show off on a resume.</p>
        <p>The project is open source, under the ISC licence, and the git repository is located <a href="https://github.com/CuAnnan/nodesaken" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you want to start using it here, you will need to register an account first. I intend on eventually handling anonymously created characters, but binding to account is easier and frees me to program the more interesting stuff sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>Changes to the character are made by pressing the level you want to acquire. If you have CP left, they are used. Otherwise, XP is spent. The system currently provides no means to add XP, it merely stores how much XP is spent.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Very little of the Forsaken&trade; Template has been programmed yet. Skills, attributes, forms, derived attributes are all done, merits are mostly done; the framework for loading and saving characters is done and the things that are done save and load properly</p>
        <p>Remaining work includes Primary Urge, Renown, Gifts, Rites, Totem and Pack. Also the templates for Wolf Blooded and human.</p>
        <p>I'm not adding functionality for the other supernatural templates as it would involve a lot of reading for how their splats work. If you are that interested in those splats, check out the code and start learning JavaScript</p>
